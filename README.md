Get alerts when a "dumb" appliance starts or stops based on SW-420 vibration sensor. In this example I'm attaching these to the back of a washer and dryer in a shared house to allow remote notification based on laundry room activity. 

While I'm using this for washer and dryer units, this concept may be extended to other "dumb" appliances. For instance, you could use a thermocouple to send an alert when the oven is ready, etc.
